# Egg Playground

Egg Playground is an exploration of

+ the interactive narrative method of [easter eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media))
+ the causality dilemma of [the chicken or the egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg)

using simple html, css, and javascript - no image or audio files.

## To Play
1. At page load, you will be presented with either a chicken or an egg.
2. If there is a chicken, you can lay a matching color egg.
3. If there is an egg, you can crack it.
	1. When you crack it, it plays a musical note generated by javascript that is associated with the egg color
	2. and then the egg goes away
4. If you touch the chicken or it gets impatient, it will turn into a color pinata
5. You can make music.
	1. If you crack wisely, you can get a song!
	2. If you want my suggestion, crack teal - salmon - gold - teal - salmon - teal - salmon - gold - teal - salmon

## Issues + Future
+ the audio is not perfect in iOS Safari
+ use svg patterns to fill the eggs?
+ add animation?
+ add a cracked egg svg?
+ add a screen record function?
+ maybe create a frame for the coop?
+ sometimes a dinosaur and not a chicken?
